<h1>About Hawking</h1>
  <p>
    Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 â€“ 14 March 2018) was an English
    theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his
    death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology
    at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, he was
    the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge,
    widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.

    Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959,
    at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College,
    Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October
    1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of
    Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied
    mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity
    and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an
    early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually,
    over decades, paralysed him. After the loss of his speech, he
    communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of
    a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.
